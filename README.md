# nyc_covid_tracker

Built using Python, Plotly, and Dash. The Beautiful Soup and Requests packages were used to collect the data. Cleaning and wrangling were performed with Pandas. The data contains COVID-19 cases per NYC zip code tabulation area. The app fetches polygon geo-coordinates for each zip code area, and then plots the final data on a Choropleth map using Plotly and Dash. The app was deployed on a Heroku server.

The COVID-19 data comes from NYC Healthâ€™s GitHub repository. The coordinate data comes from Iowa.gov.
